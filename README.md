# What does that mean?

The community mission is transferring DevOps knowledge by practice. We are implementing an open source web app (www.devopsloft.io), while picking up DevOps technologies, like: git (GitHub), AWS, Linux, scripting, Jenkins, Chef/Ansible.

The goal of the community is addressing the lack of experienced DevOps specialists to fulfill the increasing demand.

# How?
